## Project requirements
## I have met the requirement for project 1 by working with Github by using the demo repo to understand how to add functions that make different fonts and linking to websites. 
#link to github repo (https://github.com/jlim9027/cat-meme.git)
#[link to meme website](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fmemes%2Fhuh-cat&psig=AOvVaw3xciAmUvS9KfFZppYFcZH7&ust=1710330860304000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBUQjhxqFwoTCPCLiZDV7oQDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

## My meme
![](inspo_meme.jpg)
## The key components I changed from the inspo_meme is the image and text. I changed the image to a dog photo and changed the text from "HUH?" to "WHAT?"
Describe the key components of the image you re-created and the features you changed
When you knit your Rmd file to HTML, your meme will be produced and included in the output (make sure your R code does produce your meme as output)
Include the code used to create your animated meme in the code chunk labelled “animation-code”
When you knit your Rmd file to HTML, your animated meme will NOT be produced and included in the output
Instead, include the GIF you created in Part B using markdown

```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}
library(magick)

meme <- image_read("p1.jpeg")

# Add text "what" in the middle of the image
img_with_text <- image_annotate(meme, "WHAT?", size = 200, gravity = "center", color = "black")

# Display the final image
image_browse(img_with_text)

# Save meme as image file
image_write(img_with_text, "my_meme.png")

# Create animation
frame1 <- image_read("my_meme.png")
frame2 <- image_read("p2.jpeg")
frame3 <- image_read("p3.jpeg")
frame4 <- image_read("p4.jpeg")

rs1 <- image_scale(frame1, "400x400!")
rs2 <- image_scale(frame2, "400x400!")
rs3 <- image_scale(frame3, "400x400!")
rs4 <- image_scale(frame4, "400x400!")

my_meme <- image_append(c(rs1, rs2, rs3, rs4))
my_meme
```

## My animation

```{r animation-code, eval=FALSE}
# Append frames horizontally to create animation
myanimation <- image_animate(my_meme, fps=1)
myanimation
# Save animated GIF
image_write(myanimation, "my_animation.gif")

```
